# react-native-material-components
[WIP] A react native wrapper for Google's material library: https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios

# Installation to your react native projects
1. install npm modules  

```
  $ npm install --save https://github.com/Sw0rdstream/react-native-material-components/tarball/master
  $ react-native link
```

This will add the library project into the library groups of your main projects. 

2. Make your ios project into a Pod project (You can skip it if you don't need ios)
3. Add `material-components-ios` into your pod dependency 
Add MaterialComponents to your podfile, because our library is a wrapper of the components inside the pod.

```
pod 'MaterialComponents'
```

(FYI, the ios lib project of react-native-material-components adds `$(CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/**` into `USER_HEADER_SEARCH PATHS` so that it can refer React library and Pod library)

4. Install material-components-ios
```
  $ pod install
```

# Example

```javascript
import {MDCRaisedButton} from 'react-native-material-components';

export default YourUIComponent extends React.Component {
 Â  render(){
      return (
      <View style={{flex:1}}>
        <MDCRaisedButton />
      </View>
      );
   }
};

```
